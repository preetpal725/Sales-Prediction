# Sales-Prediction
Sales Prediction using LSTM model on PySpark and Koalas

We have prepared this use-case for PySpark application and to get familiar with Koalas dataframe. The advantage of using Spark is that it makes your
solution highly scalable. You don't have to worry about the dataset size anymore. This solution will guide you how to implement deep learning solution
using LSTM algorithm.

Koalas, on the other hand, is another API that runs on top of Spark Dataframe. The advantage of using Koalas is that, the code is same as what you do
in Pandas but it runs on top of Spark Dataframe instead, which according to me is the best solution available out there at this time. It is easy to use
and you don't have to change much if you're changing your non-scalable Machine Learning solution to scalable one.

NOTE: At this point of time, the data file is not available. I'll upload it once I get some changes done.

Enjoy!
